The goal
Implement the Conwayâ€™s Game Of Life algorithm in C++. The Game Of Life is a cellular automaton algorithm. It runs on a universe, which is two-dimensional a grid of cells. Each cell can be in two states: alive or dead. There is an initial state for the universe, which defines alive cells and their positions in the universe. The automaton progresses one step at a time by applying a set of rules to each cell in the universe. There rules are the following: 
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives;
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell;
All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
